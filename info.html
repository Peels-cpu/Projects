      <!-- Status Conditions. -->
      <h1>Status Conditions</h1>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Poisons</h2>
      <img src="./images/poison status.png " class="container-fluid typeTable mb-4 accordion-item" style="max-width:600px ;" alt="poisoned revomon">
      <p>One status condition that is perfect for stalling is poison. There are two types of poison, normal poison and bad poison.</p>
      <p>Normal poison reduces the victim's HP by 12.5% of its maximum each turn. </p>
      <p>A meganundra using toxic spikes once will initiate Normal poison, or revomons with the ability poison point who are attacked with a physical move will poison targets.</p>
      <p><h3></h3>Bad poison gradually increases every turn, meaning that every turn the poison will hurt more and more.</p>
      <p>The move Toxic or a meganundra using toxic spikes twice will induce <i>Bad poison</i>.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Burns</h2>
      <img src="./images/burned status.png" class="container-fluid typeTable mb-4 accordion-item" style="max-width:600px ;" alt="poisoned revomon">
      <p>The picture above with the craggon on fire is a burn status condition.</p>
      <p>Burns will decrease the affected Revomons's HP by 12.5% of its maximum at the end of each turn. In Revomon, this is the only effect burns have until specified or changed by the developers.</p>
      <p>Moves like Wil-o-wisp and scald can induce burns, and abilities like flame body when hit with a physical move will burn the attacker.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Paralysis </h2>
      <img src="./images/paralized status.png" class="container-fluid typeTable mb-4 accordion-item" style="max-width:600px ;" alt="poisoned revomon">
      <p>Paralysis reduces the affected Revomon's Speed to 25%.</p>
      <p>Every turn it also gives a 25% for the victim to be fully paralyzed and will be unable to attack that turn.</p>
      <p>As strong as this status condition is, electric and earth type revomons are immune to it.</p>
      <p>Moves Thunder wave, body slam, thunderbolt, discharge, stun spore, and glare will paralyze targets, more moves that are unlisted can induce paralysis. Abilities like static when hit with a physical move will have a 30% chance to paralize the attacker.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Sleep </h2>
      <img src="./images/sleep status.png" class="container-fluid typeTable mb-4 accordion-item" style="max-width:600px ;" alt="poisoned revomon">
      <p>The creation of the sleep clause rule, a common competitive rule effectively stating that only one Pokemon on each team may be asleep at a timeâ€”might suggest that sleep is a very dangerous status effect.</p>
      <p>When the revomon is put to sleep, a number is put into effect, the number between two and four will be randomly generated and each time the "fast asleep" message is displayed, the counter decreases by one, until the counter reaches zero and the Revomon wakes up.</p>
      <p>A sleeping Revomon is unable to use any moves, unless they use the moves Sleep Talk or Snore. </p>
      <p>The move Rest will only and always last two turns of sleep which is self inducing to regain full HP and remove all other status conditions.</p>
      <p>Abilities like Insomnia and Vital Spirit prevents sleep.</p>
      <p>Moves like hypnosis, sing, yawn, sleep powder and Grass whistle will put the target to sleep.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Frozen</h2>
      <img src="./images/frozen status.png" class="container-fluid typeTable mb-4 accordion-item" style="max-width:600px ;" alt="poisoned revomon">
      <p>The strongest status condition and the most difficult to inflict. Frozen revomon will not be able to attack until it thaws out. Each turn, it has a 20% chance of thawing out. It can even thaw out on the same turn it was frozen. However, it can also never thaw out unless it hits that 20%- A VERY low percentage, this is why it is so dangerous.</p>
      <p>Ice types are immune to being frozen, the worst type for defence so it deserves it.</p>
      <p>The following moves like Blizzard, Ice beam, Ice Fang, and Ice punch can induce freeze all having a (10%) of freezing the target.</p>
